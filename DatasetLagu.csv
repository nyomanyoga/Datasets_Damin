Artis,Judul,Lirik
Niki,Ocean and Engines,"Saturday sunset
We're lying on my bed with five hours to go

Fingers entwined and so were our minds
Cryin', ""I don't want you to go""

You wiped away your tears
But not fears under the still and clear indigo
You said, ""Baby, don't cry, we'll be fine
You're the one thing I swear I can't outgrow""

My mother said the younger me was a pretending prodigy
Well, nothing then, much has changed
'Cause while you're wolfin' down liquor
My soul, it gets sicker
But I'm stickin' to the screenplay
Gotta say I'm okay, but answer this, babe
How is it now that somehow you're a strangеr?
You were mine just yеsterday

I pray the block in my airway dissipates
And instead deters your airplane's way

But heaven denied
Destiny decried
Something beautiful died
Too soon

But I'm letting go
I'm givin' up the ghost
But don't get me wrong
I'll always love you, that's why
I wrote you this very last song
I guess this is where we say goodbye
I know I'll be alright
Someday I'll be fine
But just not tonight (ooh)

Plungin' into all kinds of diversions
Like blush wine and sonorous soirées
But even with gin and surgin' adrenaline
I see you're all that can intoxicate

Oceans and engines
You're skilled at infringin' on great love affairs
'Cause now my heart's home
All I've known is long gone and ten thousand miles away

And I'm not okay

But I'm letting go
I'm giving up the ghost
But don't get me wrong
I'll always love you, that's why
I wrote you this very last song
I guess this is where we say goodbye
I know I'll be alright
But just not

Tonight was the first time I stared into seas
Of beguiling sepia two years ago
And the first time I learned real world superpowers lived in three words
They revitalize my fraying bones, oh
Now what do you do when your pillar crumbled down
You've lost all solid ground
Both dreams and demons drowned
And this void's all you've found
And doubts light it aglow?

I have so many questions
But I'm pouring them into the ocean
And I'm starting up my engine

And I'm letting go
I'm givin' up your ghost
It's come to a close
I marked the end with this last song I wrote
I'm letting go
This is the last falsetto
I'll ever sing to you
My great lost love"
Taylor Swift ,August ,"Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of ""Are you sure?""
""Never have I ever before""

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""
So much for summer love and saying ""us""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
'Cause you were never mine, never mine

But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said, ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
""Meet me behind the mall""

Remember when I pulled up and said, ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (for the hope of it all)

For the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
(For the hope of it all)
(For the hope of it all)"

The 1975,Robbers ,"She had a face straight outta magazine
God only knows but you'll never leave her
Her balaclava is starting to chafe
And when she gets his gun he's begging, ""Babe, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.""

I'll give you one more time
We'll give you one more fight
Said one more lie
Will I know you

Now if you never shoot, you'll never know
And if you never eat, you'll never grow
You've got a pretty kind of dirty face
And when she's leaving your home she's begging you, ""Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.""

I'll give you one more time
We'll give you one more fight
Said one more line
Be a riot, cause I know you

Well, now that you've got your gun
It's much harder now the police have come
Now I'll shoot him if it's what you ask
But if you just take off your mask
You'd find out everything's gone wrong.

Now everybody's dead
And they're driving past my old school
He's got his gun, he's got his suit on
She says, ""Babe, you look so cool, you look so cool, you look so coo-o-o-oo-oo-ool.
You look so cool, you look so cool, you look so coo-o-o-oo-oo-ool."""
Rex Orange County,Pluto Projector,"[Verse 1]
The great protector
Is that what I'm supposed to be?
What if all this counts for nothing
Everything I thought I'd be?
What if by the time I realize
It's too far behind to see?
Seventy-mil projector
I can show you everything, yeah
And we're on our way to glory
Where the show won't ever end
And the encore lasts forever
And it's time we're due to spend

[Verse 2]
Spending the years together
Growing older every day (Every day)
I feel at home when I'm around you
And I'll gladly say again
I hope the encore lasts forever
Now there's time for us to spend
And it's sublime with you, my friend
This right here still feels like a honeymoon
When you say my name, nothing's changed
I'm still a boy inside my thoughts
Am I meant to understand my faults?

[Chorus]
I don't think so
I don't think I'm meant to understand myself
Maybe you do
And that's good for you
Maybe in time
Maybe one day
I'll do the same
(I'll do the same
I'll do the same
I'll do the same)

[Bridge]
I'll do the same as you
I'll try and hold it up
Soon I hope
Or as soon as I'm old enough
(Old enough to understand
Old enough to understand)

[Outro]
Stay forever, you know more than anyone (Yeah, whoa)
And it's you that knows my darkness
And you know my bedroom needs
You could blast me and my secrets
But there's probably just no need"
Rex Orange County,AMAZING,"[Verse 1]
There's no way to time it
And where you may find it
Is unknown
Until then, you're a loner
So you see her (See her)
She's over (Over)
In the corner (Corner)
And you can't (You can't)
Ignore her (Ignore her)
There must be a reason
You see it, believe it now

[Pre-Chorus]
Search the definition of ""shame""
I'm sure you'll see my face
Who's gonna save me now?
I hope it's you, my babe

[Chorus]
Don't change a thing, you are amazing
I can't believe you've come and saved me
We can stay here, spend every day here
I don't mind, no
Don't change a thing, you are amazing
I can't believe you've come and saved me
We can stay here, spend every day here
I don't mind

I see her
She's over in the corner
And I can't ignore her
I hope there's a reason
To see it, I see it (Now, oh)

Search the definition of ""afraid""

I can't believe you've come and saved me
We can stay here, spend every day here

Rex Orange County,SHADE,"[Intro]
(Two, three, four)

[Verse 1]
I was closing all the blinds
Just so you could sleep the night through
I was staying by your side
Just so I knew you were okay
And I was opening the door
Just to see if you would walk through
I started painting all the walls
Just to see if you liked the shade

[Chorus]
I would love just to be stuck to your side
Not with anybody else, anybody else
It's enough just to keep us occupied
Please don't go
I would love just to be stuck to your side
Not with anybody else, anybody else (Don't go)
It's enough just to keep us occupied (Please don't go)

[Verse 2]
You were holding out your hands
Hoping I'd be there to hold to
I went out to Amsterdam
Just so I could givе you some space
But I kept opеning my door
Just to see if you would walk through
But now I'm painting all my walls
Just to see if you like the shade

[Chorus]
I would love just to be stuck to your side
Not with anybody else, anybody else
It's enough just to keep us occupied
Please don't go
I would love just to be stuck to your side
Not with anybody else, anybody else (Don't go)

Rex Orange County,Uno,"[Intro]
Yeah, I don't know where to start
How do you admit that you're falling apart?
I mean, how will I admit that I'm falling apart?
My mother's gonna worry but I'm fine in my heart
I've lived the words that I've said
And I live with a voice that tends to tell me that I'm shit in my head
Well maybe I should fuck it and be happy instead
I should just say ""fuck it and be happy instead"", right? Right

[Verse 1]
'Cause there's a lot of people tryin' to tell me how to deal with myself
But I'm not gonna listen if you mention my health
I don't care, don't tell me and don't text me
'Cause that kind of shit upsets me, just kind of affects me

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's bringing me down, and I'm not gonna lie
These days I prefer to just not be outside
And these days I just end up spending all of my time
With my girlfriend, but to be honest, I think that's alright

[Chorus]
'Cause time keeps rollin' and I'm just makin' songs
(I'm doing my best, still find myself stressed)
And I'm no longer sure where I belong
(I'm starting to rust, don't know who to trust)
(Don't trust anyone. Not even me.)

[Verse 2]
Some people concentrate on style too much
But I think I just force myself to smile too much
And that should soon end for the best
I wanna live my life with no stress
Love life and feel blessed, like
It's kind of funny on the inside
I'm tryin' to be a man, but really I'm just a little child, shit
And that's pretty much it, yeah, that's pretty much it
(Is there anything else?)

[Verse 3]
Oh yeah
My jaw hurts a lot because I grind it with stress (Uh-huh?)
I was an idiot recently and lost a lot of my friends (Aw)
Nothing brings me joy and nothing makes me smile
Being at school makes me aware of how I haven't been myself in awhile (Oh)
And I wonder what it was like to be 11
Wonder if there's such a thing as life after death, such a thing as heaven (Why?)
And every now and then I think about the fact that I'd become a legend if I died at 27"
Rex Orange County,Untitled,"I make enough mistakes
And it feels like she's the only one that hears the things I say
So if for any reason there's some miscommunication or I'm lying to her face
My immaturity and habits getting in the way
'Cause I can barely breathe and I don't know how I'll explain myself this time
Wish it wasn't a case of this time
But why can't I be any other boy
That doesn't need a hand in love?
Someone that I would trust
But how did I fail
To give you all the love that you deserve?
When you're the only thing that's worth what life is worth
And I don't mind if you hate me
'Cause, baby, if I were you, I would probably hate me too
I said that I don't mind if you hate me
'Cause, baby, if I were you, I would probably hate me too"
Rex Orange County,Can i Open a window,"[Chorus: Rex Orange County]
Can I open a window?
Can somebody open the door?
There's so many reasons
I can barely take it anymore

[Verse 1: Rex Orange County]
Stuck here and I never seem to get away, but I'll hang on
Seasons change, but you don't ever, oh
Oh, soon as I can see your face, I'm fine I'm sure
I'm tryna find a way to get out

[Chorus: Rex Orange County]
So can I open a window?
Can somebody open the door?
There's so many reasons

[Verse 2: Rex Orange County]
Fuck this, I might leave the people tellin' me what I should do
They want change, but you don't еver, oh
Oh, tryin' to ignore the thought of wanting to
But еvery single time that I do, I'm like, um

[Chorus: Rex Orange County]
Could I open a window?
Can somebody open the door?
There's so many reasons
I can barely take it anymore, no

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Yeah, so what the fuck?
Niggas feelin' stuck, really feelin' stuck
Like the middle car on freeway pile up with semi-trucks
Open door, but you can't
Try to run, but you pant
Out of breath, you can't vent
'Cause the AC actin' up
Nah, really, if somethin' feelin' dirty to me
At the roots like a tree, see, I just up and I leave
It ain't pertainin' to me, I don't engage, I don't care
They like, ""You get it?"" I'm like, ""Yeah,"" and get the fuck out of here
See, I concur, I'm modest, I'm Tyler, I'm honest
I never bite my tongue, it's for the better, I promise
You stuck, then move, because I'm running, like sinus
I knows, they quiet like that last E in ""silence""

There's so many reasons
I can barely take it anymore

Arctic Monkeys,Piledriver Waltz,"I etched the face of a stopwatch on the back of a raindrop
And did a swap for the sand in an hourglass
I heard an unhappy ending, it sort of sounds like you leaving
I heard the piledriver waltz, it woke me up this morning
You look like you've been for breakfast at the heartbreak hotel
And sat in the back booth by the pamphlets and the literature on how to lose
Your waitress was miserable and so was your food
If you're gonna try and walk on water
Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes
Mysteries flashing amber go green when you answer
But the red on the rest of the questionnaire never changes
I heard the news that you're planning to shoot me out of a cannon
I heard the piledriver waltz, it woke me up this morning
You look like you've been for breakfast at the heartbreak hotel
And sat in the back booth by the pamphlets and the literature on how to lose
Your waitress was miserable and so was your food
If you're gonna try and walk on water
Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Arctic Monkeys,No.1 Party Anthem,"So you're on the prowl wondering whether
She left already or not
Leather jacket, collar popped like Cantonna
Never knowing when to stop
Sunglasses indoors, par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles
Call off the search for your soul
Or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke
And she calls the folks who run this, her oldest friends
Sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem
She's a certified mind blower
Knowing full well that I don't
May suggest there's somewhere from which I might know her
Just to get the ball to roll
Drunken monologues, confused because
It's not like I'm falling in love, I just want ya
To do me no good
And you look like you could
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem, yeah, yeah
The look of love, the rush of blood
The ""She's with me""'s, the Gallic shrug
The shutterbugs, the Camera Plus
The black & white and the color dodge
The good time girls, the cubicles
The house of fun, the number one
Party anthem, oh
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

Arctic Monkeys,Cornerstone,"I thought I saw you in the Battleship
But it was only a look alike
She was nothing but a vision trick
Under the warning light
She was close
Close enough to be your ghost
But my chances turned to toast
When I asked her if I could call her your name
I thought I saw you in the Rusty Hook
Huddled up in wicker chair
I wandered up for a closer look
And kissed whoever was sitting there
She was close
And she held me very tightly
'Til I asked awfully politely
""Please, can I call you her name?""
And I elongated my lift home
Yeah, I let him go the long way 'round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself
I thought I saw you in the Parrot's Beak
Messin' with the smoke alarm
It was too loud for me to hear her speak
And she had a broken arm
It was close
So close that the walls were wet
And she wrote it out in Letraset
""No, you can't call me her name""
Tell me, where's your hiding place?
I'm worried I'll forget your face
And I've asked everyone
I'm beginning to think I imagined you all along
I elongated my lift home
Yeah, I let him go the long way 'round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself
I saw your sister in the Cornerstone
On the phone to the middle man
When I saw that she was on her own
I thought she might understand
That she was close
Well, you couldn't get much closer

Nickelback,Photograph,"Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
How did our eyes get so red?
And what the hell is on Joey's head?

And this is where I grew up
I think the present owner fixed it up
I never knew we'd ever went without
The second floor is hard for sneaking out

And this is where I went to school
Most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice
I must have done it half a dozen times

I wonder if it's too late
Should I go back and try to graduate?
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in

Oh, whoa, whoa
Oh, God, I...

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye

Remember the old arcade
Blew every dollar that we ever made
The cops hated us hangin' out
They say, ""Somebody went and burned it down""

We used to listen to the radio
And sing along with every song we know
We said, ""Someday we'd find out how it feels
To sing to more than just the steering wheel""

Kim's the first girl I kissed
I was so nervous that I nearly missed
She's had a couple of kids since then
I haven't seen her since God knows when

Oh, God, I...

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

I miss that town, I miss the faces
You can't erase, you can't replace it
I miss it now, I can't believe it
So hard to stay, too hard to leave it

If I could relive those days
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door
I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Every memory of walking out the front door
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
It's hard to say it, time to say it
Goodbye, goodbye

Look at this photograph
Every time I do, it makes me laugh
Every time I do, it makes me..."
Bruno Mars,Just the way you are,"Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah

Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Oh, you know, you know
You know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searchin' for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother askin' if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are

Imagine Dragon,Demons ,"When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth
I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside
There's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call
It's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down
But I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you
Don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide

They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright
I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how

When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide"
bring me the horizon,Sleepwalking ,"My secrets are burning a hole through my heart
And my bones catch a fever
When it cuts you up this deep
It's hard to find a way to breathe
Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper, shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe
Time stood still the way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking
I'm at the edge of the world
Where do I go from here? Do I disappear?
Edge of the world
Should I sink or swim? Or simply disappear?
Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper, shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe, sing it
Time stood still the way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Wake up
Take my hand and give me a reason to start again
Wake up
Pull me out and give me a reason to start again
Time stands still
Time stands still

Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper, shadows start to sing

linkin park ,A Place for my head,"I watch how the moon
Sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
And the sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's going to owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You do
Favors then rapidly, you just
Turn around and start asking me about
Things you want back from me
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head
Maybe someday I'll be just like you and
Step on people like you do and
Run away all the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm, used to be strong
Used to be generous but you should've known
That you'd
Wear out your welcome now you see
How quiet it is all alone
I'm so
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I'm so
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

An idolized bang for the industry killer
A hideous man that you don't understand

A dream of you and I
There's no need to keep an open eye
I promise I'm the one for you
Just let me hold you in these arms tonight
I'm lucky to be me and you can see it in my face
Back when I fucked my shit up too many times
Why would I let myself get down in the first place
Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down down, do-do-down
Diggy dig down, du du du
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
And so she sat me down and told me that I didn't have to cry
Said I didn't need to get down and feel empty inside
And told me that she'll love me for as long as she's alive
And well, maybe she's right, 'cause I hate it when I feel like I'm not me
See, I honestly, don't even know why
I, I honestly don't even know why

When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
And high up above, or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face, and I

So how come things move on? How come cars don't slow
When it feels like the end of my world?
When I should but I can't let you go?
But when I'm cold, I'm cold
When I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me when I'm in shadow
There's a feelin' within me, an everglow
Like brothers in blood or sisters who ride
When we swore, on that night, we'd be friends 'til we die
But the changin' of winds and the way waters flow
Life is short as the fallin' of snow
And now I'm gonna miss you, I know
But when I'm cold, I'm cold
In water-rolled salt
And I know that you're with me, and the way you will show
And you're with me wherever I go
But you give this feelin', this everglow
Oh-ooh
Oh, what I'd give for just a moment to hold
Yeah, I live for this feelin', this everglow

So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you left me will everglow"

I bleached half my hair when I saw Zoe on your Vespa
It was orange from three-percent peroxide, thanks to you
I needed a good cry, I headed right to Kendra's
I hated you and I hoped to God that you knew

Now there's drama (Drama), found a club for that
Where I met ya (Met ya), had a heart attack
Yadda, yadda
At the end, yeah, we burned

Had no chance against the Marxist girl with marijuana
I was your piñata, she was a star-charter
Glad she gave it to you real hard, but I loved you harder

When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays

And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
(The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone

Niki,Take A Chance With Me,"His laugh you'd die for, his laugh you'd die for
The kind that colors the sky
Heart intangible, slips away faster
Than dandelion fluff in the sunlight
And he's got swirls of passion in his eyes
Uncovering the dreams he dreams at night
As much and hard as he tries to hide
I can see right through
See right through
His voice you'd melt for, he says my name like
I'd fade away somehow if he's too loud
What I would give for me to get my feet
Back on the ground, head off the clouds
I laugh at how we're polar opposites
I read him like a book and he's a clueless little kid
Doesn't know that I'd stop time and space
Just to make him smile
Make him smile
Oh, why can't we for once
Say what we want, say what we feel?
Oh, why can't you for once
Disregard the world and run to what you know is real?
Take a chance with me
Take a chance with me
Ooh
Ooh
His kiss you'd kill for, just one and you're done for
Electricity surgin' in the air
He drives me crazy, it's so beyond me
How he'd look me dead in the eye and stay unaware
That I'm hopelessly captivated
By a boy who thinks love's overrated
How did I get myself in this arrangement?
It baffles me too, baffles me too
Oh, why can't we for once
Say what we want, say what we feel?
Oh, why can't you for once
Disregard the world and run to what you know is real?
In the end, we only regret
The chances we didn't take
I'll be your safety net
So why not raise the stakes?
I can hear your heart from across the room
Pulsin' through my veins, I know you need this too
Lie to me all you please
I can see right through
See right through
Oh, why can't we for once
Say what we want, say what we feel?
Oh, why can't you for once
Disregard the world and run to what you know is real?
Oh, why can't we for once
Say what we want, say what we feel?

Coldplay,Viva la vida,"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead, long live the king
One minute, I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman Cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never, never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

I've completed all the courses, I need to understand my loneliness
I've accepted that maybe we're meant for a different time
But then out of the blue, a spark or two
Seems to generate
Now I'm bothering you, it's bothering me
What can I do? What should I do?
We're not too far, look where we are
Bothering me, bothering you
We fill our days with hypotheticals (ooh-ooh)
Living vividly in our minds (ooh-ooh)
We take apart our dreams with heavy heart

Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics

Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothin'
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in 20 lifetimes, I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite"

Baby, angels like you can't fly down hell with me
I'm everything they said I would be
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything (everything)
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
Baby, angels like you can't fly down hell with me, oh
Angels like you can't fly down hell with me"
Bruno Mars,When i was your man,"Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
It all just sounds like ooh, ooh, ooh, hoo
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like ooh, ooh, ooh, hoo
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party 'cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man"
Adele,Someonne like you,"I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things, I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
""Don't forget me, "" I beg
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
""Don't forget me, "" I begged
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
""Don't forget me, "" I beg
I remember you said
""Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead""
Never mind, I'll find someone like you

Gym class heroes,Stereo Hearts,"My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-ote
Make me your radio
And turn me up when you feel low (turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (right there)
Just sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Hero, baby)
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like it yikky yeah, check it Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my hearts a stereo that only plays for you

(Oh, oh-oh, oh) just sing along to my stereo
Let's go!
If I was an old-school, fifty-pound boombox (remember them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops?
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (never know)
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close (listen)
Hear my thoughts in every no-ote

Just sing along to my stereo (sing along like)
to my stereo
(Oh, oh-oh, oh) just sing along to my stereo
I only pray you'll never leave me behind (never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (so hard to find)
I take your hand, hold it closer to mine (yeah)
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no-ote
Make me your radio

You've got your family, and they need you there
Though I've tried to resist, being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy, living all alone
My friends try and tell me, find a man of my own
But each time I try, I just break down and cry
Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient, just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy
I've got to get ready, just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door
For tonight is the night, for feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yes I'm saving all my love
Yes I'm saving all my love for you

No other woman, is gonna love you more
Cause tonight is the night, that I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yeah I'm saving all my love
Yes I'm saving all my love for you

It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try
And in our time that you wasted

Made it from the bottom

And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Telling me the chances I blew up
Or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show
You can tell it I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for

She always belonged to someone else
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow, I want more
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
Tap on my window, knock on my door, I
Want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
Doesn't matter anymore
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come any time you want, yeah
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and makes me catch her
Every time she falls, yeah
Tap on my window, knock on my door, I
Want to make you feel beautiful
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved, yeah
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye"
Maroon 5,This Love,"I was so high, I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again but always in my heart, oh
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again, but uh-oh
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
I'll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's all right (it's all right, it's all right)
My pressure on your hips, I'm sinking my fingertips
Every inch of you
Because I know that's what you want me to do
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breakin' in front of me
And she said goodbye too many times before
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore"
John Mayer,Slow Dancing in a Burning Room,"It's not a silly little moment
It's not the storm before the calm
This is the deep and dying breath of
This love that we've been working on
Can't seem to hold you like I want to
So I can feel you in my arms
Nobody's gonna come and save you
We pulled too many false alarms
We're going down
And you can see it too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear
We're slow dancing in a burning room
I was the one you always dreamed of
You were the one I tried to draw
How dare you say it's nothing to me?
Baby, you're the only light I ever saw
I'll make the most of all the sadness
You'll be a bitch because you can
You try to hit me just to hurt me
So you leave me feeling dirty
'Cause you can't understand
We're going down
And you can see it too
We're going down
And you know that we're doomed
My dear
We're slow dancing in a burning room
Go cry about it, why don't you?
Go cry about it, why don't you?
Go cry about it, why don't you?
My dear, we're slow dancing in a burning room
Burning room
Burning room
Don't you think we oughta know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?
Dont you think we oughta know by now?
Dont you think we should have learned somehow?
Don't you think we oughta know by now?
Don't you think we should have learned somehow?"
Bring Me The Horizon,Sleepwalking,"My secrets are burning a hole through my heart
And my bones catch a fever
When it cuts you up this deep
It's hard to find a way to breathe
Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper, shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe
Time stood still the way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking
I'm at the edge of the world
Where do I go from here? Do I disappear?
Edge of the world
Should I sink or swim? Or simply disappear?
Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper, shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe, sing it
Time stood still the way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Wake up
Take my hand and give me a reason to start again
Wake up
Pull me out and give me a reason to start again
Time stands still
Time stands still
(Time stands still)
(Time stands still)
Your eyes are swallowing me
Mirrors start to whisper, shadows start to sing
My skin's smothering me
Help me find a way to breathe
Time stood still the way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking
Fell into another hole again
It's like I'm sleepwalking (it's like I'm sleepwalking)
Time stood still the way it did before
It's like I'm sleepwalking"
Bring Me The Horizon,Parasite Eve,"I've got a fever, don't breathe on me
I'm a believer in nobody
Won't let me leave 'cause I've seen something
Hope I don't sneeze, I don't
Really we just need to fear something
Only pretending to feel something
I know you're dying to run
I wanna turn you around
Please, remain calm, the end has arrived
We cannot save you, enjoy the ride
This is the moment you've been waiting for
Don't call it a warning, this is a war
It's the Parasite Eve
Got a feeling in your stomach
'Cause you know that it's coming for ya
Leave your flowers and grieve
Don't forget what they told ya, ayy, ayy
When we forget the infection
Will we remember the lesson?
If the suspense doesn't kill you
Something else will, ayy, ayy
Move
I heard they need better signal
Put chip and pins in the needles
Quarantine all of those secrets
In that black hole you call a brain before it's too late
Really we just wanna scream something
Only pretend to believe something
I know you're baying for blood
I wanna turn you around
Please, remain calm, the end has arrived
We cannot save you, enjoy the ride
This is the moment you've been waiting for
Don't call it a warning, this is a war
It's the Parasite Eve
Got a feeling in your stomach
'Cause you know that it's coming for ya
Leave your flowers and grieve
Don't forget what they told ya, ayy, ayy

When we forget the infection
Will we remember the lesson?
If the suspense doesn't kill you
Something else will
You can board up your windows, you can lock up your doors, yeah
But you can't keep washing your hands of this shit anymore
When all the king's sources and all the king's friends
Don't know their arses from their pathogens
When life is a prison and death is the door
This ain't a warning, this is a war, war
This is a war, ayy, ayy, oh, oh
It's the Parasite Eve
Got a feeling in your stomach
'Cause you know that it's coming for ya
Leave your flowers and grieve
Don't forget what they told ya, ayy, ayy
When we forget the infection
Will we remember the lesson?
If the suspense doesn't kill you
Something else will, ayy, ayy
It's the Parasite Eve, ayy, ayy
It's the Parasite Eve, ayy, ayy
It's the Parasite Eve (Parasite Eve), ayy, ayy

We cannot save you
We cannot save you
We cannot save you
We cannot save you
We cannot save you"
Diego Gonzalez,You & I,"And I'll never leave you
And you are the one that was there for me
And I
I cannot lose you again
There's something so special about you
And I can't shake this great feeling
I don't wanna lose

d4vd,Sleep Well,"Do you think about me every night? Before you go to sleep (Yeah) I know you must be terrified Of what you might see in your dreams, but  [Chorus] I'm here for you still And even if you don't think that I'm near I'll still be right next to you, my dear (Hmm) And the way you make me feel Has the power to make the whole world stand still Who's to say that our love ain't real?

Taylor Swift ,August ,"Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of ""Are you sure?""
""Never have I ever before""
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""
So much for summer love and saying ""us""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
'Cause you were never mine, never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said, ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
""Meet me behind the mall""
Remember when I pulled up and said, ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (for the hope of it all)
For the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
(For the hope of it all)
(For the hope of it all)"
Adele,SkyFall,"This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At Skyfall
At Skyfall
Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart
Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At Skyfall
Where you go, I go
What you see, I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand
Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
Face it all together
At Skyfall
Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At Skyfall
Ooh"
David Bowie,Starman,"Didn't know what time it was the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll 
Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no DJ that was hazy cosmic jiveThere's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhileAnd he told me:
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogieI had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out so you heard him too
Switch on the TV we may pick him up on channel two
Look out your window I can see his light
If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in frightThere's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it's all worthwhileAnd he told me:
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie"
Red Hot Chili Peppers,Soul To Squeeze,"I got a bad disease
Out from my brain is where I bleed
Insanity it seems
Has got me by my soul to squeeze
With all the love from me
With all the dyin' trees, I scream
The angels in my dream, yeah
Had turned to demons of greed, that's mean
Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, got to, gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time
Today love smiled on me
He took away my pain, said, ""Please""
""I'll let your ride be free""
""You gotta let it be, oh, yeah""
Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, gotta, gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give ya some of my good time
Yeah!
Oh, so polite indeed
Well, I got everything I need
I'll make my days a breeze
And take away my self-destruction
It's bitter baby and it's very sweet
Holy rollercoaster, but I'm on my feet
Take me to the river, let me on your shore
I'll be comin' back maybe, I'll be comin' back for more
Doo-doo dingle zing a dong bone
Ba-di ba-da ba-zumba crunga cong gone bad
I could not forget, but I will not endeavor
Simple pleasures are much better but I won't regret it never
Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, got to, gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time
Where I go, I just don't know
I might end up somewhere in Mexico
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna keep ya for the end of time"
Post Malone,Chemical,"Oxytocin makin' it all okay
When I come back down, it doesn't feel the same
Now I'm sittin' 'round, waitin' for the world to end all day
'Cause I couldn't leave you if I tried
You break me, then I break my rules
Last time was the last time too
It's fucked up, I know, but I'm still
Outside of the party, smokin' in the car with you
Seven Nation Army, fightin' at the bar with you
Tell you that I'm sorry, tell me what I gotta do
'Cause I can't let go, it's chemical
No, I can't let go, it's chemical
Every time I'm ready to make a change
You turn around and fuck out all my brains (woo)
I ain't tryna fight fate, it's too late to save face
I can't get away, maybe there's no mistakes (maybe there's no mistakes)
You break me, then I break my rules
Last time was the last time too
It's fucked up, I know, but I'm still
Standing outside of the party, smokin' in the car with you
Seven Nation Army, fightin' at the bar with you
Tell you that I'm sorry, tell me what I gotta do
'Cause I can't let go, it's chemical (chemical)
No, I can't let go, it's chemical (chemical)
No, I can't let go, it's chemical
I can't let go, it's chemical
Tell you that I'm sorry, tell me what I gotta do
No, I can't let go, it's chemical"
Michael Learns to Rock,The Actor,"He takes you out and he takes you up
'Cause he can show you so much
I go to bed and tomorrow again
There's a lot of work to be done
He gives you gold and he will promise you
The whole world will be yours
I just can't tell you I love you so
Even though my odds are low
I'm not an actor, I'm not a star
And I don't even have my own car
But I'm hoping so much you'll stay
That you will love me anyway
The dirty games in the name of jokes
This is the world he knows
Watching the stars satisfies my soul
Thinking of him makes me feel so cold
The fancy cars and the restaurants
You're just so fond of the man
Sometimes I wonder if you are blind
Can't you see he's got dirt on his mind
I'm not an actor, I'm not a star
And I don't even have my own car
But I'm hoping so much you'll stay
That you will love me anyway (anyway)
I'm not an actor, I'm not a star
And I don't even have my own car
But I'm hoping so much you'll stay
That you will love me anyway
I'm not an actor, I'm not a star
And I don't even have my own car
But I'm hoping so much you'll stay
That you will love me anyway (anyway)
I'm not an actor, I'm not a star
And I don't even have my own car
But I'm hoping so much you'll stay
That you will love me anyway
I'm not an actor, I'm not a star
And I don't even have my own car
But I'm hoping so much you'll stay"
Bon Jovi,It's my life,"This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for faith-departed
And I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud
It's my life
It's now or never
But I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, ""I did it my way""
I just want to live while I'm alive
It's my life
Yeah, this is for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina, who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky, got to make your own breaks
It's my life
And it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, ""I did it my way""
I just want to live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life
Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down
It's my life
And it's now or never
'Cause I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, ""I did it my way""
I just want to live while I'm alive
And it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, ""I did it my way""
I just want to live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life"
Avenged Sevenfold,Danger line,"My 16 locked and loaded
All fear has been avoided
You say the words and my weapon is drawn
This one could be my last time
Some people call it war crime
I may be staring down a lethal sight
To die
Nothing shocks you like a bullet hole
Leaving my fear on the danger line
Suffering no man should ever know
Leaving my faith on the danger line
I do this for my family
My daughter loves her daddy
Too many talk down on things they don't know
With colors never faded
Reckless and unabated
They may take me, but never take us all
I'll crawl
Nothing shocks you like a bullet hole
Leaving my fear on the danger line
Suffering a man should never know
Leaving my faith on the danger line
I know what you're thinking
I've been there before
So think of the times
The time we spent laughing away
So think of the times (times at home)
(Life without a care)
Now I find myself in my own blood
(Never thought I'd lie in my own blood)
The damage done is far beyond repair (ah-ah-ah-ah)
I never put my faith in up above
(Never had much faith in up above)
But now I'm hoping someone's there
I never meant to leave this world alone
I never meant to hurt the ones who care
And all this time I thought we'd just grow old
You know, no one said it's fair
Tell my baby girl that it's alright
I've sung my last song today
Remind the Lord to leave his light on for me
I'm free"
